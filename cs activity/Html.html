         <p> All the activities of humans driven by greed and selfishness have caused immense damage to the earth.
          It is degraded it beyond repair. 
          Almost all the natural resources are now polluted due to these activities.
        </p>
        
        <p>As all human activities are impacting the lives of other organisms, humans only need to take steps to protect the earth and its resources. 
            A little effort will go a long way on everyoneâ€™s end. 
            Each action will make a difference. 
            For instance, if one man decides to stop drinking bottled water, thousands of plastic can be saved from consuming.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we can start by planting more trees to make up for the deforestation that is happening these days at a rapid rate. 
                When we plant more trees, ecological balance can be restored and we can improve the quality of life.

                Similarly, we must stop wasting water. When done on individual levels, this will create a huge impact on conserving water. 
                We must not pollute our water bodies by dumping waste in it. 
                It is essential to save water most importantly as it is running out rapidly.</p>
